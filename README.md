# IkeaStoreApp_Clone
This is a clone from Ikea store app. I wanted to build to apply the best practices I learned in MVVM and Xamarin in general. 
One of my main goals here is to work on the optimisation level, such as if I am able to figure out a way to solve an issue 
with my own code instead of using external packages, it will be definitely the way to go, as less unecessary packages as much efficiency and maintainability in my opinion.
I could be useful to someone else who wants a ready template that almost ready from front-end to backend.
